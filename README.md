# Bulk File Renamer

This Python script automates the process of renaming multiple files in a directory by adding a specified prefix to their names.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script (`bulk_file_renamer.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/script
    ```

4. Run the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    python bulk_file_renamer.py
    ```

5. The script will prompt you to enter the directory path and the new prefix.

6. After entering the required information, the script will rename each file in the specified directory and print the old and new file names.

## Example

```bash
Renamed: old_file1.txt -> new_prefix_1.txt
Renamed: old_file2.txt -> new_prefix_2.txt
Renamed: old_file3.txt -> new_prefix_3.txt
```
